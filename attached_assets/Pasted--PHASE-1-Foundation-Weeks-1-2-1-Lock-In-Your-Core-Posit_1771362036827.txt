🔥 PHASE 1: Foundation (Weeks 1–2)
1️⃣ Lock In Your Core Positioning

Your refined message:

Meet people nearby — without the pressure.
Social Go empowers you to connect confidently with people around you and around the world in real time.

Now tighten this into:

1 clear headline

3 benefit bullets

1 strong CTA

No fluff. Clear outcome.

2️⃣ Infrastructure Checklist (Non-Negotiable)

Before traffic hits:

✅ Custom domain (socialgoapp.com)

✅ SSL enabled (HTTPS)

✅ Privacy Policy

✅ Terms of Service

✅ Age verification if under 18 not allowed

✅ Basic moderation tools

✅ Database backup system

✅ Analytics (Google Analytics or PostHog)

✅ Error monitoring (Sentry)

This is what separates “idea app” from “real company.”

3️⃣ Choose a Launch City

Don’t launch “worldwide” immediately.

Pick ONE:

College campus

Orange County nightlife

Gym community

Events / festivals

Car meets (fits your car interest)

Hyper-focus creates density. Density creates value.

📈 PHASE 2: Soft Launch (Weeks 3–6)

Goal: 200–500 users in one area.

1️⃣ Seed the App

Before public launch:

Create 20–50 realistic profiles

Add updates

Make it feel alive

Empty apps die instantly.

2️⃣ Campus / Local Strategy

Example: If launching in Orange County:

Hire 3 campus ambassadors ($200 each)

Run QR code flyers

Offer “Founding Member” badge

Do a giveaway (AirPods, gym membership, etc.)

You need urgency.

3️⃣ TikTok Strategy

Post:

POV: “When you want to talk to someone but can’t”

Live reactions testing the app

Street interviews

Before & after social anxiety clips

Post 2x daily for 30 days.

Organic > Paid at this stage.

💰 PHASE 3: Monetization Setup (Weeks 6–10)

Once you have 300+ users active:

Introduce Social Go Pro

Example features:

See who viewed you

Boost visibility

Unlimited Go Mode

Event priority access

$4.99–9.99/month

Even 5% conversion proves model viability.

🧠 PHASE 4: Data & Investor Readiness (Weeks 8–12)

Track:

Daily Active Users (DAU)

Retention after 7 days

Average session time

Conversion rate

Investors care about:

Retention > downloads

Engagement > hype

Once you hit:

1,000 users

30% 7-day retention

3–5% paid conversion

Now you pitch.

🦈 How You Position to Investors

Not:

“It’s a social app.”

But:

“We’re building the real-time social layer for in-person connection globally.”

Big vision.
Focused execution.

🌎 Expansion Plan (After Product-Market Fit)

City by city:

College towns

Major metros

International student hubs

Do NOT scale before density works locally.
